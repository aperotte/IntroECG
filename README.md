# IntroECG

This repository is meant to be a useful resource library for getting started with deep learning work using electrocardiograms. 

## AutoECG
Generate your own synthetic electrocardiograms. Comes with the ability to alter many different aspects of the waveform to test different hypotheses

## Ignite-Optuna
A framework built on PyTorch Ignite using Optuna to allow for rapid experimentation and displaying your results using Tensorboard

## Models
Different example models we've built to showcase approaches that work for electrocardiograms
